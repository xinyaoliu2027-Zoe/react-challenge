# React + TypeScript + Vite + Vitest

A starter template for building React 19+ apps in TypeScript with Vite and TailwindCSS 4. Includes Vitest for unit testing and
a hefty .gitignore file. React compiler enabled.

# Requirements

Node 22 or greater.

## Usage

```
mkdir your-app-name
cd your-app-name
npx degit criesbeck/react-ts-vitest
npm install
```
Note: degit sometimes fails to say it is done after announcing it has cloned the repo.
If that happens, type control-C and then do `npm install`.

## Test

Verify that the initial app works. Run

```
npm start
```

Open the URL displayed. Click on the counter to increment it.

Then verify that the unit tests work with

```
npm test
```

Two tests should run and pass. 

## Scripts

**package.json** defines the following scripts:

| Script           | Description                                         |
| -----------------| --------------------------------------------------- |
| npm start        | Runs the app in the development mode.               |
| npm run dev      | Runs the app in the development mode.               |
| npm run build    | Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. |
| npm run serve    | Serves the production build from the `dist` folder. |
| npm test         | Starts a Jest-like test loop                        |
| npm run coverage | Runs the tests, displays code coverage results      |


## Git

If everything is working, set up [your local and remote repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github#adding-a-local-repository-to-github-using-git).
